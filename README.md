# Trip planning and discovery data analysis

[Vooyai](https://vooyai.com) is a website for travel discovery and recommendation. I built it last year with a friend and has been stalled since November 2023. I figured it may be interesting to perform some analysis on the data we have compiled during it's existence.

I will try to regularly include new notebooks exploring different techniques and performing different analysis over our data, with a twofold purpose: to apply and refresh data science concepts, and to share insights that may be useful to someone interested in travel trends or data analysis. 

If you are interested in Vooyai's tech stack, I have a small blog post about this project at https://www.jmontalvo.me/projects/vooyai

## Notebook Indices
**I will try to regularly update this repository with new analysis and insights**


0. [Initial exploration of Vooyai data, with some figures and  results.](notebooks/0_initial_exploration.ipynb)
1. [Sentiment Analysis: Exploring the Relationship Between User Prompt Sentiment and Vooyai's Country Recommendations](notebooks/1_sentiment_analysis.ipynb)


## Data Availability 
As of now, data is not available publicly, but hopefully the insights and code may be useful for others to build on.

I *may* release some curated data for some notebooks in the future.
