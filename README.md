# Analytics on Vooyai's Data

This repository contains the code and data analysis for the Vooyai project, an AI-powered travel planner of which I'm a cofounder. You can check out Vooyai at https://vooyai.com and I have a small blog post about this project at https://www.jmontalvo.me/projects/vooyai

Geolocation for all the different destinations recommended by Vooyai.


## I will try to regularly update this repository with new analyses and insights



### Data 
As of now, data will not be available publicly, but hopefully the insights will be of some use to others, and code may be useful for others to build on.
